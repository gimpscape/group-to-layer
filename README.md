### Note

This extension owned by stuart@pernsteiner.org, you can found the original work by following [this link](http://www.pernsteiner.org/inkscape/group_to_layer/). Unfortunatelly this extension only work for inkscape 0.92.x, so we make some modification base on original code in order to make this ekstension work for Inkscape 1.0
